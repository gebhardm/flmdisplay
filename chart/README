This is an alternative chart display for Fluksometer data
stored in a database; it purely uses the socket connection
to transfer data.
This script relies on the fact that the persist_mqtt.js is
running and corresponding table flmdata is available in the
mySQL database flm - see ../persist for details.

Running ./chart.sh starts a node.js based web server serving
a page on port 8080 on the host's IP address.
Access it by http://<host ip>:8080

Make sure node modules mysql and socket.io are installed; if
they are not installed (actually must be as otherwise the
persist service cannot be working), install them using npm.

Displaying the served page, press the "refresh" button to
get initial data (and a clue on the format) in the input
fields. On submit the corresponding database query is performed
and values are displayed in a flotchart - up to 2 hours on
second base; above 2 hours averaged on minute base. Note that
there is a retrieve limit of around 12 hours continuous data;
this does not take extremely long, but also "normally" triggers
a memory overflow on browser side...

As a gimmick you can use your mouse to select a smaller interval
within the displayed graph that will lead to a more detailed view
on this selection. Below the graph a button "reset" is shown to
return to the initial selection - this works browser based; there is
no roundtrip to the server or database.

The display of the graph scales with the window width and tries to
reach a 4:3 ratio, optimally viewed on an iPad or Kindle Fire.
