persist_mqtt.js is a .js script running on node.js to persist Fluksometer
readings in a MySQL database. It connects to the FLM's MQTT broker on the
specified IP address (change it to your FLM's or broker's address!)
After start the script checks if the persistence table in the database FLM
exists; if not, it creates the table.
Subcribing to the sensor topics, the script starts to insert received
values in the database for later retrieval, e.g. by the chart.
