To use the mySQL database for storing data not only via the root user
you have to set up a corresponding "other" user; this can be done from
the mySQL command line by following commands:

Log into the mySQL database called 'flm':
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ mysql -u root -p flm

mysql> create user 'pi'@'localhost' identified by 'raspberry';
mysql> grant all privileges on flm.* to 'pi'@'localhost';
mysql> flush privileges;
mysql> set password for 'pi'@'localhost' = password('raspberry');
mysql> quit

Now you may log on to the database also as user 'pi':
pi@raspberry ~ $ mysql -u pi -p flm

mysql> show databases;
mysql> show tables;
mysql> select count(*) from flmdata;

Note: If the database flm was not created beforehand, make so by 
mysql> create database flm;
mysql> use flm;
