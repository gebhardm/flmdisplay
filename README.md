Visualization hacks for the Fluksometer

Content
-------

This repository contains the collected scripts implemented
to persist and visualize readings from the www.flukso.net provided
Fluksometer, an open source, community smart metering appliance.

It actually is a fork of 
http://github.com/gebhardm/energyhacks/tree/master/RaspberryPi
to keep up with evolving reuse components, for example socket.io.

All folders contain a README that describes the intention of the contained
script and its usage. ("Wer lesen kann, ist klar im Vorteil")

Note that css/ and js/ are just script storages of reuse components without
further information - on these you have to use the original sources...
(I will not Google this for you)

All code provided under the respective licences; if not denoted otherwise
the MIT licence is the one to care about...
