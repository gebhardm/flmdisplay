Visualization hacks for the Fluksometer

Content
-------

This repository contains the collected scripts implemented
to persist and visualize readings from the www.flukso.net provided
Fluksometer, an open source, community smart metering appliance.

It is actually a fork of 
http://github.com/gebhardm/energyhacks/tree/master/RaspberryPi
to keep up with evolving reuse components, for example socket.io.
