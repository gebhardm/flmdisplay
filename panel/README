An MQTT-panel adaptation to the flukso.net Fluksometer.
"serve_panel.js" is a JavaScript running on node.js. It serves as
a MQTT message to socket.io pipe with an integrated simple http
server. The provided page (index.html) displays data of all retrieved
FLM sensor gauges; the panel.html includes the counters also.

How to use
==========
To run the script install node.js; easiest from http://github.com/joyent/node.
Install node.js using the command sequence
"git checkout v0.10.28-release", "./configure",  "make" and "sudo make install".

Install the MQTT and socket.io modules with "npm install mqtt socket.io". Be aware
that these modules evolve; there was an issue with incompatible changes using
socket.io as v0.9 behaves differently than v1.0 - so, even though I tested the
stuff, it may not work with a next version of the used modules...

Usual execution
---------------
On a running node.js installation just run the ./panel.sh script to start
the server - be aware to adapt the MQTT client address in the serve_panel.js
to your local FLM's address - no further configursation is needed (again,
be aware of version incompatibilities within the environment used!)
Point your wherever located browser to the web server's IP address port 1080,
in my example http://192.168.0.70:1080 - the index.html page is loaded

Have fun.
